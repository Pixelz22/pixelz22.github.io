                    A first-person 3D horror game about escaping from a lab while avoiding a raging monster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game focuses heavily on maneuvering your way around the messy laboratory, trying to
                    pull off tasks and make your escape, all while avoiding the notice of the monster, who roams around
                    the lab hunting for you. The AI makes use of both sight and sound, requiring you to be quiet
                    when it's nearby, lest you give away your position. Be careful though... you can't hold your breath
                    forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was made as the final project for my Game Design class at Wake Technical Community College.
                    It was made with a group of 2 others. My responsibilities involved programming the monster's AI,
                    UI programming, visual effects, the sound design, and implementing the sound in the game, along with
                    assisting the other programmer with various game mechanics.

                <h3>Remarks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Monster's AI uses a custom version of A* that runs on a separate thread to avoid
                        lag during gameplay.</li>
                    <li>A preprocessing step is run on the environment to separate it into regions,
                        which allows the AI to quickly identify impossible paths. This is done via
                        a simple flood-fill algorithm ran on a compute shader.</li>
                    <li>The monster's grunts are passed through a lowpass filter as it goes behind walls,
                        giving the player more information about monster's location.</li>
                    <li>All the ambient noise was made by distorting the sounds of breathing, mouth percussion,
                        spoons, glass cups, and the background noise on my old headset mic.</li>
                    <li>Lots of lore was planned out for the game, but got cut due to sudden time shortages.
                        The result was less than perfect.</li>
                </ul>

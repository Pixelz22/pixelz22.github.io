                        A piano duet that falls deeper into madness as it continues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had gotten the idea for writing a piano duet after performing Brahm's "Hungarian Dance No. 5"
                        with my piano teacher. All my previous compositions had been for solo piano, and I was intrigued
                        by the opportunities that multiple instruments would offer. I quickly took to the style and
                        began writing a piano called "Winter March." I declared it finished and stopped writing for a
                        while, but I never felt satisfied with it. A few months later, I had the idea to revisit the piece.
                        I renamed it "Insomnia," partially a joke on the countless hours of sleep I had lost writing the piece.
                        With the name, everything clicked. I started leaning hard into the themes of insanity, adding unusual
                        harmony and many chromatic aberrations. This gave the piece a unique personality, and it now stands
                        in my mind as one of my finest piano works.

                    <ul>
                        <li>This piece won the NC State Creative Artist Award of 2024.</li>
                        <li>I attempted to perform this piece with my piano teacher, but we had to cut sections from
                            the song due to being pressed for time. As such, there is no full live recording of this
                            piece. The recording on this page is a highly tailored computer playback.</li>

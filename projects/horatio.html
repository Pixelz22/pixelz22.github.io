                        A short puzzle-platformer about manipulating your surroundings with various spells.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You play as Horatio, a small wizard trying to make his way through a mystical temple to test
                        his mastery over spellcraft. The player is given three spells. Launch lets you throw
                        objects around the room. Swap lets you exchange positions with an object while maintaining speed.
                        The third spell is Rewind, which lets you move objects backwards through time. You must use
                        all three in order to complete the puzzles and make it to the end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was made as the final project for my CSC 281 (Game Design) class at NC State University.
                        It was made with a team of three others. I was responsible for the majority of the programming and UI, and
                        all the music and sound design.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Remarks</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The logic of the mechanics was very simple. Most of the programming effort
                            went into polishing the user experience through particles, a clear UI,
                            and responsive VFX that gave the player feedback for their actions.</li>
                        <li>Time reversal is achieved by recording the object's position, rotation, and velocity
                            at regular intervals and interpolating backwards through those snapshots.</li>
                        <li>When time moves backwards, the game music will play in reverse.</li>
                        <li>Though most of the art was handled by our wonderful artist Tim,
                            the title card was made by me when he fell ill.</li>

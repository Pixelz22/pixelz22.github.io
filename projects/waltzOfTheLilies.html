                <p>
                    A different take on my other original work,  <a href="vallesLiliorum.html" target="_blank">"Valles Liliorum,"</a>
                    now arranged as a waltz for string quartet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was revisiting my old pieces and wondered what it would look like if I redid them
                    with my newfound compositional skills. "Valles Liliorum" seemed like a prime opportunity,
                    as the left hand was doing simple triads practically the entire time.
                    I changed to a waltz style and started adding simple countermelodies in the left hand, as I adore
                    a rich bassline. I added more colorful extensions to the chords and a more intricate harmony.
                    As I continued to work on the piece, it became clear my ideas went beyond the scope of solo piano.
                    That's when I decided to make this my first string piece. This opened up the door for all my ideas
                    and more.

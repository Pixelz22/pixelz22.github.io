                <p>
                    A text-based adventure game about escaping from a Prisoner-of-War camp in Cold War Era Russia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's been four years since the storm... four years since you crashed that plane on Russian soil.
                    Since that unforgettable day, your life has been a matter of survival, whether from the harsh treatment of the guards,
                    or the taunts and side-eyed looks of other prisoners. You've were just about to resign yourself to your fate,
                    when a faint glimmer of hope appears one fateful morning. You're getting out of here. You have to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Play as American pilot Corinne Dumont as she attempts to sneak her way out of a Russian prisoner-of-war camp.
                    Talk to guards and fellow prisoners. Collect information, and use it to manipulate the setting to your advantage.
                    Everything runs on a schedule here: patience will be your ally.
                </p>

                    This was made as a project for my CSC 281 (Game Design) class at NC State University.
                    The whole game was made using the <a href="https://twinery.org/" target="_blank">Twine</a> engine.

                <ul>
                    <li>My first ever narrative-focused game!</li>
                    <li>The game uses HTML hyperlinks to move around the world and advance the story.</li>
                    <li>There were originally plans for 3 other storylines and endings, but they had to be cut
                        due to time constraints.</li>

                <h2>Hi there!</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is <strong>Tyler Johnson</strong>, a passionate programmer, composer, and sound engineer.<br/>
                    I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at North Carolina State University.
                </p>
                <h2>My Story:</h2>
                <p class="max-width-50em">
                    Video games have always been my favorite pastime, even when I was little.
                    After playing through Pokemon Gold on my cousin's computer, I came to a decision: I was going to make one of these things. <br/><br/>
                    That goal has driven me throughout my life: That goal is what started my programming journey at eleven years old.
                    That goal is what pushed me to personal study of math and music, of physics and game mechanics, of graphics programming and engine structure.
                    That goal is what drove me to apply to NC State University at fifteen years old. <br/><br/>
                    Even now, as I finish up my Master's degree, I've built up a strong set of skills and experience
                    that I've readily applied in many fields, not just game development...<br/><br/>
                    <strong>...and I'm eager to put them to work for you!</strong>
                </p>
